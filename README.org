org
  --------------------------------------------
 | This is my journey on using Emacs org-mode |
  --------------------------------------------

* Configuration:
** Child Hierarchy:
/This Snippet Makes Parent Headers unDONEable if the children is not DONE/
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
    (quote ((sequence "TODO(t)" "NEXT(n)" "|" "DONE(d)")
            (sequence "WAITING(w@/!)" "HOLD(h@/!)" "|" "CANCELLED(c@/!)"))))
#+end_src

*** TODO Test:
/Works fine/
**** DONE one
That is a trial demo for me to visaulise is it working or not
**** TODO two
**** DONE three
** Cute characters instead of asterisk:
This Snippet
This is the cute starts that are positioned before a heading (default they all are asterisks)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Installed with M-x package-install RET org-bullets RET
(use-package org-bullets
      :ensure t
      :config
      ;; Tbh It's pretty random now. But I can change it later
      (setq org-bullets-bullet-list '("▶" "◉" "§" "Σ" "Ψ" "Ω" "β" "δ" "ᗧ" "᠉" "⋑" "✸")))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: t
** Changing ellapsis:
This is going to change the extension of shrinked header:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! org
  ;; Setting folded header identifier
  (setq org-ellipsis "⤸") ;; ⤵ :arrow_down: ⤸ :arrow_up: ▾ :arrow_down_small: ▴
)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ⤸
